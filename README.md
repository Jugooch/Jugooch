## ðŸš€ Projects:

### [University Student Application](https://github.com/jugooch/gcu_student_app)
> Flutter, Firebase, Dart, Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud

**Description**: This Application is a redesign of Grand Canyon University's (GCU's) mobile student application. The point of this redesign was to condense the amount of applications that GCU students have to download. As of right now, students download upwards of 8 to 9 applications to do various GCU-related tasks; this app shrinks that down to 1. The problem's students had with downloading so many apps is the amount of space it took up on their device, and the poor user experience that was related to moving between multiple applications just to do small everyday tasks. This app reduces the amount of space taken up, and also improves that user experience by keeping everything important for every-day life in one location. It utilizes Flutter as a frontend framework to support use across different platforms and is designed based on an entire UI/UX case study done on current GCU students.

### [ClearStack AI Landing Page](https://www.clearstack.ai/)
> Vue, Heroku, JavaScript, Figma, HTML, CSS

**Description**: A landing page I was contracted to build for ClearStack AI. Using Figma for design, I collaborated closely with the company's founders to iteratively create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. Extensive user testing was conducted to ensure simplicity and ease of use, resulting in a landing page that effectively communicates the company's value proposition while providing a great user experience.

### [ODDSpot Sports Odds](https://github.com/jugooch/ODDSpot-Sports-Odds)
> C#, Vue, Azure, Heroku

**Description**: A dynamic website built using Vue and C#, designed to display sports betting odds via a third-party API. This project aimed to provide users with real-time sports data, enhancing their betting experiences with accurate and timely information. Designed collaboratively in Figma, the website's UI/UX was crafted with user engagement at the forefront, ensuring ease of navigation. The development process involved a team working together through Git for version control, and the final product was deployed using Heroku and Azure for seamless access and reliability.
